## How to Send Newsletters

### Step 1: Export Subscribers
1. Go to `https://regular-puma-clearly.ngrok-free.app/newsletter.html`
2. Enter admin password
3. Click "Export CSV"
4. You'll get a file like: `nexus-subscribers-1733270400.csv`

### Step 2: Prepare Email
1. Open the template you want to use (e.g., `update-template.html`)
2. Customize the content:
   - Update version number
   - Add your features/updates
   - Change the CTA link if needed
3. Save your customized version

### Step 3: Send via Proton Mail

**Using Plain Text:**
1. Open Proton Mail
2. Click "Compose"
3. Add emails to BCC (paste from CSV)
4. Write your message
5. Include unsubscribe link at bottom
6. Send!

**Using HTML Template:**
1. Copy the HTML from your template
2. Use an online HTML-to-Email tool (like https://htmlemail.io/inline/)
3. This "inlines" the CSS for better compatibility
4. Copy the result
5. In Proton Mail, click the `<>` (HTML) button
6. Paste your HTML
7. Add emails to BCC
8. Send!

### Step 4: Track (Optional)

## 📝 Newsletter Best Practices

### Content:
- **Keep it short** - People skim
- **One main topic** - Don't overwhelm
- **Clear CTA** - What do you want them to do?
- **Visual hierarchy** - Use headings, bullets
- **Personal tone** - "Hey!" not "Dear valued user"

### Timing:
- **Consistent schedule** - Monthly or when major updates
- **Don't spam** - Quality over quantity
- **Good subject lines** - "Nexus v3.1.0: 80% Faster!" not "Update"

### Legal:
- ✅ Always include unsubscribe link
- ✅ Honor unsubscribes immediately  
- ✅ Don't share/sell email list
- ✅ CAN-SPAM compliant (we are!)

## 🎯 When to Send

**Good reasons:**

- Just because it's been a week
